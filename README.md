# Blasteens Subgraph
<p align="center">
  <img alt="Blasteens" src="public/images/blasteens.png" width="500" >
</p>
A subgraph, tailored for the Blasteens platform, is a custom API designed to interact with blockchain data. It employs the GraphQL query language for data requests and utilizes the Graph CLI for deployment to a Graph Node. After deployment, when published on The Graph's decentralized network, Indexers process these subgraphs, enabling them to be accessible for queries by Blasteens' subgraph consumers.
